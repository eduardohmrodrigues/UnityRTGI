#**Unity Real Time Geometry Importer**

## Synopsis

This project was written in C# using the [Unity Engine](unity3d.com). It is a geometry importer script for unity, where the user can import geometry assets in execution time, without the needing of compile it with the project!

## Motivation

This project was motivated because at some time of my studies i came across the need of render some geometry on my application, but this geometry was an entry of the user and i noticed that this was a complicated task to do with the avaliable features. So i started implementing this functionality only for .obj extensions, but i want to expand this code to render the most embracing number of extensions as possible.

## Installation

You only need to install the [Unity Engine](unity3d.com) and open the project.
+ This project was started on unity 5.4.1f1 version.
